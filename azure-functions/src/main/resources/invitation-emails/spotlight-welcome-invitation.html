                Dear customer,
            </p>
            <p class="important-text">
                <b>
                    We're very pleased to have %CUSTOMER_NAME% as a new subscriber to our UCaaS Continuous Testing Service.
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You have been designated as the Primary Administrator of this Service for your company. This email
                will explain the next steps in becoming a UCaaS Continuous Testing Service subscriber.
            </p>
            <p class="important-text">
                <b>
                    We're setting up your account right now.
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the UCaaS Continuous Testing Service will run on your live operations network, we're purchasing MSClient [OC or
                Direct Route] accounts and obtaining phone numbers from %CUSTOMER_NAME%. Once we've gotten a time frame from your company, 
                you'll see another email letting you know our expected date for UCaaS Continuous Testing Service activation.
                We typically activate by the next business day once we've received phone numbers from your company.
            </p>
            <p class="important-text">
                <b>
                    Once the Service is activated you will see another email from us.
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                In that one, we'll take you to our onboarding wizard and in just a few minutes, you, and the
                stakeholders you designate, will be receiving reports and notifications.
            </p>
