                                            by Licensee. Licensor may assign or transfer its rights and/or duties under

                                            do not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The words
                                            “includes” and “including” are not limited in any way and mean “includes or
                                            including without limitation.” The word “will” is a synonym for the word
                                            “shall.” The term “and/or” means each and all of the persons, words,
                                            provisions or items connected by that term; i.e., it has a joint and several
                                            meaning. Both Parties have had the opportunity to have this Agreement
                                            reviewed by their attorneys. Therefore, no rule of construction or
                                            interpretation that disfavors the Party drafting this Agreement or any of
                                            its provisions will apply to the interpretation of this Agreement. Instead,
                                            this Agreement will be interpreted according to the fair meaning of its
                                            terms.</li>
